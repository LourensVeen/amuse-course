# Installing AMUSE on Windows

AMUSE does not run directly on Windows, as computational scientists almost exclusively
use Linux (supercomputers all run Linux) or macOS (because people like Macs, and Linux
on Apple Silicon is still being worked in).

However, Windows has a built-in Linux environment called Windows Subsystem for Linux, or
WSL. You can install and use AMUSE in there instead.

If you already have an Ubuntu WSL environment set up on your computer, then you can use
that. If not, follow the
[instructions here](https://canonical-ubuntu-wsl.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/guides/install-ubuntu-wsl2/)
to set up an Ubuntu environment on your Windows computer.

Once you have this working, you can continue by following the
[Ubuntu instructions](https://github.com/LourensVeen/amuse-course/blob/main/ubuntu.md)
in the WSL Ubuntu terminal window.
