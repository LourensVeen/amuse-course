# Installing AMUSE

Installing AMUSE is currently not as easy as we'd like for it to be. We're working on
a brand new build system and installer, with the goal to have AMUSE available on
conda-forge. This turns out to be a significant engineering project however,
and we need a bit more time.

In the mean time, the existing system still works, but it has some issues and the
instructions on the AMUSE website will give you an error if you follow them. This will
all be fixed in the future, but for now we have this page to explain how to get AMUSE
installed on your system, or at least enough of it to be able to do the coursework.

The instructions differ a bit per operating system. Please select yours below to
